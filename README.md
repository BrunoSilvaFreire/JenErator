# Jen Erator
## A C++ AST library
Jen Erator is a library that parses and abstracts C++'s AST for ease of use.    
This makes it very useful when trying to do things like: 
* Code Generation
* Refactoring tools
* Analyzing code  

The project is still under heavy development and experimentation, so expect big changes, bugs, and head scratching  
Also, contributors are always welcome, feel free to open issues and pull requests.

## Road Map
1. Finish C++ parsing
2. Write a comprehensible wiki
3. Integrate some kind of code generation framework
4. Other languages support
